# Rusty-Lake-Underground-Blossom
This project is designed to automate the gameplay of a minor level in the "Rust Lake-Underground Blossom" game and generate a solution.

Game Rules:
Seeds can be positioned within slots containing small holes. The initial location of a single worm is in the small hole at the top left corner. When seeds are placed on the small hole where the flyer is situated, the flyer will burrow out from the next adjacent small hole in the direction indicated by the seed. If there is no small hole in the specified direction of the seed, the worm will vanish. To succeed, you must strategically position the seeds so that the flyer eventually emerges from the small hole marked with a circle.

这个项目用来自动玩锈湖-地铁繁花中的一个小关卡并生成答案。

游戏规则：
瓜子可以摆放在有小洞的位置。一只虫子的起始点在左上角的小洞。当瓜子摆放在虫子所在的小洞上时，虫子会沿着瓜子指向的方向从下一个小洞钻出来。如果瓜子指向的方向没有小洞，虫子消失。需要适当摆放瓜子使得虫子最终从画圈的小洞钻出来。
